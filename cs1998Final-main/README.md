A "Quizlet" style full-stack application that enables users to add decks of flashcards to class repositories -- currently, there are a few hard-coded classes, within which users 
who can signup/login, can create decks based on units. For example, in CS 2110, User "Mary Joe" may decide to create Deck "Djikstra's Algorithm," which is associated
one-to-many with individual cards. There is a random quiz mode on backend, or the option to look at cards as desired. Tech Stack is Flask (Python) for backend and 
SQLAlchemy for database + ORM, and Swift for frontend (IOS application).
